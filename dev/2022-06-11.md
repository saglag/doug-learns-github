# What we did today
* https://github.com/saglag/doug-learns-github
* Created a `specialMath` module containing `add`
* Created an experiment file that uses `add`
* Created a test file that tests `add` for correctness

## Starting a new GitHub repo
* Create repo on GitHub
* Clone the (empty) repo to the local computer
* Work locally (creating files, etc) and use GitHub Desktop to "commit" changes at good save points
* Use GitHub Desktop to "push" changes to the cloud

## Big-Picture Goals
  * Just get the program working
  * Write a test to confirm it is working
  * Have GitHub run the test
  * Add features

# Project Description
* Load an ABF and get mean value between two time points for every sweep


## Test with GitHub Actions

Place this in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to test automatically in the cloud
